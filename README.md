# This is namaste React Web-Series

# Parcel do the following things for us:
-- 1. Dev Build (Apne ko ye smjh nahi aaya) (Dive deep later
)
-- 2. Local server

-- 3. HMR (Hot Module Replacement) {Isi ki wajah se jab ham apne file me kuchh change karte hai to hamare localhost jaha hamara app hoisted hai waha khud change reflect ho jata hai bina refresh kiye}

** Parcel uses an algorithm namely "File Watching Algorithm" which help the parcel to track all the changes in the files

-- 4. Caching (Due to it, it gives  faster build of the app) (Dive deep later)

-- 5. Image optimization (Dive deep later)

--6. Minification of file in production developement

-- 7. Bundling (Because it is a bundler, so the basic work of it is to bundle the app)

-- 8. Compress the file (How?)

-- 9. Consistent hashing (Dive deep later)

-- 10. Code spliting (Dive deep later)

--11. Differential Bundling (Gives support to the older browser)

--12. Better Error Handling (By pointing out the exact line and reason of error in a beautiful view)

-- 13. HTTPS

-- 14. Diagonstic

-- 15. Tree Shaking

-- 16. Transpilation
